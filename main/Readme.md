- bsecompanies.py - extract company names
    output is bse_companies.csv

- company_data_Extractor.py - extract company details into json
    extracts company data using url

- stock.py - working on it
    for a given stock it give the basic quote data using bse


I have to shift it to database


PLAN IS UPDATE THE bse_companies.csv add sector induxtry small and midcap data as well so we can filter it in ui

after filtering we have to pick stocks to work on so that we have to select from ui

then we have to use bse library code to extract and then compare and then we have to use bse url code if required



future

do graphrag for the financial documents
